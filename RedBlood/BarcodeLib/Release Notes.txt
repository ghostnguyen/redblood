1.0.0.6
- Fixed a bug in Code128-A and Code128-B that would cause it to encode incorrectly due to incorrectly trying to compact the barcode for Code128-C.  This functionality is now bypassed if Code128-A or Code128-B is selected.
- Removed a useless variable bEncoded from BarcodeLib.cs
- Static methods now support generating the data label (required addition of a parameter to 3 of the 5 static methods used to encode).
- Property now available to retrieve the amount of time (EncodingTime) it took to encode and generate the image. (Might be helpful for diagnostics)
- Modified a few error messages to be more descriptive about correcting the problem with data length.
- Barcode class now inherits from IDisposable
- XML export functionality added to BarcodeLib to allow the data, encoded data and other properties to be exported in XML along with the Image in Base64String format.  This includes functionality to GetXML() and GetImageFromXML(BarcodeXML).
- To go along with the XML functionality there is now a dataset included that has the basic layout of the XML data, to make importing and exporting easy.
- ImageFormat is now a property to set to select what type of image you want returned (JPEG is default).  This can help speed of transferring data if using a webservice.
- ITF-14 now draws the label with the proper background color instead of always being white.
